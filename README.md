# Final Year Project ‚Äì Preparation Tutorials

This repository showcases a collection of tutorials, experiments, and practice implementations completed as part of the preparation for my final year project:  
**"Bridging Language Barriers in Coding: An NLP-Powered Tool for Programming Education in Regional Languages."**

## üìå About This Repository

The contents here include:

- Hands-on experiments with translation tools and APIs
- Explorations in Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- Small prototype tests to validate core components of the final project
- Notes and code snippets relevant to multilingual support in code education

## üöÄ Objective

The aim of these tutorials is to build a strong foundation in NLP and translation techniques that will support the implementation of the main project, which focuses on making programming education more accessible through native language support.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Explored

- Python
- Deep Translator
- Google Translate API
- NLP libraries (e.g., NLTK, spaCy)
- Streamlit (optional UI experiments)
- VS Code / Google Colab


## ‚úÖ Status

This repository is actively being updated with new learnings and practice tasks. Final implementation will be published in the main project repo soon.
